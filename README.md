# Ex-3-RECOGNITION-OF-A-VALID-ARITHMETIC-EXPRESSION-THAT-USES-OPERATOR-AND-USING-YACC
# Date:08/05/2025
# AIM
To write a yacc program to recognize a valid arithmetic expression that uses operator +,- ,* and /.
# ALGORITHM
1.	Start the program.
2.	Write a program in the vi editor and save it with .l extension.
3.	In the lex program, write the translation rules for the operators =,+,-,*,/ and for the identifier.
4.	Write a program in the vi editor and save it with .y extension.
5.	Compile the lex program with lex compiler to produce output file as lex.yy.c. eg $ lex filename.l
6.	Compile the yacc program with yacc compiler to produce output file as y.tab.c. eg $ yacc â€“d arith_id.y
7.	Compile these with the C compiler as gcc lex.yy.c y.tab.c
8.	Enter an arithmetic expression as input and the tokens are identified as output.
